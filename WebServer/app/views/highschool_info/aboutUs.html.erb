    <h3>History and traditions</h3>
    Traditions are the customs, rituals, stories and ways of thinking that those in earlier generations
    hand down to us and we in turn hand down to future generations. Traditions are very important because
    they help us understand life, who we are, where we fit in our community and world, and how the story of
    our life fits in the larger stories of our community and world.
    In our high-school , from itâ€™s beginning (in 1812), our traditions and values are based on intellectual,
    moral, physical and cultural development, enriched by students from diverse backgrounds.
